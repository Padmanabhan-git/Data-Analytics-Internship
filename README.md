# Customer Personality Analysis - Submission Package (Synthetic)

This repository contains a synthetic "Customer Personality Analysis" dataset and a reproducible cleaning pipeline suitable for submission.

Contents:
- original_dataset.csv : Synthetic messy dataset (for the exercise)
- cleaned_dataset.csv : Cleaned dataset ready for analysis
- cleaning_script.py : Reproducible script (short)
- cleaning_notebook.ipynb : Notebook with EDA and cleaning steps
- summary_of_changes.txt : Summary of transformations and assumptions
- README.md : This file

How to run:
1. Unzip the package.
2. Open `cleaning_notebook.ipynb` with Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab to inspect the EDA and cleaning steps.
3. The `cleaned_dataset.csv` is already produced; to reproduce cleaning, run the steps in the notebook or expand `cleaning_script.py`.

Notes:
- This is a synthetic dataset intended to mimic common real-world data quality issues.
- If you want the pipeline adapted to a specific real Kaggle dataset, upload it and I will run the pipeline and provide the updated package.
