Files:
- original_dataset.csv : original_dataset.csv (synthetic messy dataset)
- cleaned_dataset.csv : cleaned_dataset.csv (cleaned and ready for analysis)

Row counts:
- original rows: 308
- cleaned rows: 308

Main cleaning actions performed:
1. Standardized column names to lowercase with underscores.
2. Stripped leading/trailing whitespace from string fields.
3. Replaced placeholders ('', 'N/A', 'unknown', '--') with actual missing values.
4. Standardized 'gender' to 'Male'/'Female' where identifiable; others set to missing.
5. Converted 'age' and 'annualincome' to numeric; filled missing values with median.
6. Normalized 'familysize' to integer values (mapped textual numbers to digits).
7. Normalized education levels (High School, Bachelors, Masters, Phd).
8. Normalized marital status capitalization.
9. Cleaned profession names and filled missing professions with 'Other'.
10. Parsed 'joindate' into dd-mm-yyyy format where possible.
11. Fixed common email typos and removed invalid emails.
12. Removed exact duplicate rows.

Assumptions & Notes:
- Age and income missing values are imputed using median to avoid losing rows.
- Family size mapping uses simple rules; unusual values default to 1.
- Email validation uses a simple regex; advanced validation (MX check) not performed.
- This is a synthetic dataset created to mimic common issues present in real Kaggle datasets.
